🚀 **Inter-Campus Book Exchange Platform**
*A Smart, Sustainable Bridge for Academic Resource Sharing*

Imagine a campus where students and faculty no longer scramble to find textbooks, notes, or research papers. Instead, they log in to a sleek web platform, search what they need, and instantly connect with someone who has it — from their own college or another one across the network. That’s exactly what the **Inter-Campus Book Exchange Platform** delivers.

This web-based system acts as a **digital library and academic marketplace**, tailored to promote peer-to-peer exchange of:

* 📚 **Textbooks**
* 📝 **Lecture Notes**
* ❓ **Previous Year Papers**
* 🔬 **Research Articles**

Built with a robust **Java backend** and deployed on **Apache Tomcat**, the platform handles user requests and data processing with speed and stability. It uses **MySQL Workbench** to manage and structure data securely, ensuring quick retrieval and seamless scalability.

On the frontend, **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** bring the interface to life, offering an intuitive and responsive experience that makes resource discovery and communication a breeze. Data is passed between client and server using **lightweight JSON**, optimizing performance and making integration cleaner.

🔄 Users can search, browse, and directly contact resource owners via the platform — making the process fast, personal, and incredibly efficient.

🌱 **Why it matters:**
Beyond convenience, this system drives **academic collaboration**, **sustainability**, and **resource efficiency**. By reducing duplicate purchases and encouraging the reuse of materials, it aligns education with environmental consciousness.

🛠️ Developed and managed using **IntelliJ IDEA**, the project reflects strong software engineering practices including modular development, debugging, and iterative testing.
