The Inter-Campus Book Exchange Platform is a web-based application designed to facilitate the sharing and exchange of academic resources such as textbooks, lecture notes, previous year question papers, and research articles among students and faculty across different campuses. The platform allows users to search for specific materials and access the contact details of the resource owners, enabling direct communication for borrowing or exchanging items.

The backend of the application is developed using Java and is deployed on an Apache Tomcat server. MySQL Workbench is used for database management, ensuring efficient storage and retrieval of user and resource data. The frontend is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to deliver a responsive and user-friendly interface. JSON files are used for data formatting and communication between the client and server.

This system promotes academic collaboration and reduces resource redundancy by enabling a centralized platform for knowledge sharing. It also fosters sustainability by encouraging the reuse of study materials. The project was developed and managed using IntelliJ IDEA, providing an integrated development environment for code management and testing.
